This is a personal portfolio website built with Next.js, showcasing my skills, experience, and projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or yarn) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the development server with `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app.

### Configuration

You can customize the content and styles of the website by modifying the files under the `src` directory. Here's an overview of the main files:

- `src/pages/*`: the pages of the website, written in TSX and using Next.js routing. You can add, remove, or modify pages as needed.
- `src/styles/*`: global CSS styles used by the website, such as colors, fonts, etc. You can modify these styles to fit your branding. I recommend using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for this.
- `public/*`: static assets used by the website, such as images and fonts. You can add your own assets to this directory.

### Deployment

You can deploy this website to various platforms, such as Vercel, Netlify, or AWS. Here's an example deployment process for [Vercel](https://vercel.com/):

1. Sign up for a Vercel account and link it to your GitHub repository.
2. Create a new project on Vercel and configure the deployment settings.
3. Push your changes to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository.
4. Vercel will automatically deploy the website based on your settings.
